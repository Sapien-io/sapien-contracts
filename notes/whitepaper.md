## Introduction

The AI revolution has a missing piece: **you**. While algorithms process vast amounts of data, they lack the nuanced expertise only humans can provide. Today's fragmented AI training landscape offers no standardized way for people to monetize their knowledge, leaving a critical gap between human wisdom and machine learning.

The **SAPIEN token ($SAPIEN)** bridges this divide by powering a decentralized data foundry, already connecting over **550,000 trainers** across **100+ countries** who have completed more than **50 million tasks** for enterprise AI customers. The protocol replaces traditional QA layers with code-enforced quality and peer-reviewed standards.

At the ecosystem's core, the $SAPIEN token (an ERC20 token on Base) creates a self-regulating economy through four integrated systems: **Quality Assurance**, **Reputation Building**, **Credential/Skill Verification**, and **Task Matching**. This framework establishes "proof-of-quality," where trainers stake tokens against their work and unlock reward multipliers tied to their performance, consistency, and commitment.

As trainers commit work, they progress through experience levels, from **Trainee** to **Master**, unlocking increasingly valuable opportunities. This creates a self-sustaining hierarchy where masters maintain network standards while newcomers have clear pathways to advancement.

**The result?** A scalable solution that eliminates intermediaries. Enterprises gain access to verified professional knowledge. Experts receive fair compensation based on their contributions. Quality standards are maintained through peer validation. And every participant builds valuable onchain credentials that grow with their expertise.

Whether you're staking LP tokens, referring people, or converting early participation points to $SAPIEN, you're helping build the future of AI development; where human intelligence meets tokenized incentives to unlock the collective wisdom of humanity.

## System Overview

**A self-regulating protocol for sourcing, structuring, and verifying high-quality AI training data.**

The SAPIEN protocol enables scalable, high-integrity data production by replacing centralized quality assurance with a decentralized incentive system. It is designed to reward accuracy, consistency, and long-term participation; while enforcing standards through peer validation, staking, and reputation.

### Here's how it works:

#### 1. Task Creation and Matching
Enterprises or AI systems submit data requests — whether they need to source ground truth, structure existing data (text, audio, 2D, 3D, or 4D), or verify model outputs.

Tasks are matched to contributors based on their reputation, qualifications, and stake level.

#### 2. Staking and Participation
Before completing tasks, contributors stake tokens as collateral for the quality of their work.

- **Longer lock-ups** earn multiplier bonuses
- **Higher stakes** unlock access to premium tasks

This ensures all participants have meaningful "skin in the game."

#### 3. Work Submission and Peer Validation
Completed tasks are automatically routed to validators, who are more experienced contributors in the system.

- **Validators** earn rewards for accurate reviews
- **Poor validation** or contributor work leads to slashing and reputation penalties

This creates a self-sustaining quality loop driven by peers — not centralized reviewers.

#### 4. Reputation and Progression
Each contributor builds an onchain reputation score based on:

- Task accuracy
- Validator feedback
- Consistency and volume

As this score increases, contributors unlock:

- Higher-tier tasks
- Validator privileges
- Increased earning potential

This creates a clear, merit-based progression from **Trainee → Contributor → Expert → Master**.

#### 5. Reward Distribution
Rewards are calculated based on:

- Task type and complexity
- Performance multiplier (top 20% contributors earn more)
- Staking duration multiplier

**Example:** A contributor with high accuracy and a 6-month stake lock might earn a **1.5x performance × 1.25x stake multiplier** on task rewards.

#### 6. Reputation = Access + Earnings
Reputation is more than just a number — it governs your access to tasks, validator roles, multiplier eligibility, and future governance rights.

High reputation means higher earnings, more trust, and broader participation across the protocol.

### TL;DR Layer Function

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Staking** | Tokens used as collateral against quality |
| **Validation** | Peer review enforcement of standards through review |
| **Reputation** | Performance-based unlocks access and influence over time |
| **Rewards** | Performance & commitment scaled based on contribution |

---

## Core Token Functions

The SAPIEN token aligns incentives across the protocol through five core functions:

### Quality Assurance
Higher reputation members validate the work of newer participants, with both validators and contributors staking tokens against their performance. This creates multiple layers of "skin in the game" and enables (human in the loop) programmatic quality control.

### Economic Rewards
Token rewards scale with contribution quality, expertise level, and consistency. Validators earn additional rewards for maintaining network quality standards, creating strong incentives for excellence at all levels.

### Access Control
Stake size and reputation determine access to premium tasks, validation privileges, and reward multipliers. This creates clear progression paths for committed participants while enabling quality control.

### Governance
Token holders can participate in key protocol decisions through onchain voting, shaping the future development of the protocol (subject to future implementation).

### Network Growth
A tiered referral program incentivizes ecosystem expansion while maintaining quality standards, enabling sustainable network growth.

---

## Experience Levels

**Progression in Sapien is based on performance, not privilege.**

As you complete high-quality work and build your onchain reputation, you move through four contributor levels — each with increasing access, responsibility, and reward potential.

Reputation is scored on a **0–1000 scale**. Your current level determines the tasks you can access, your staking requirements, your validation privileges, and your reward multipliers.

### Level 1: Trainee (0-199)
*A learning phase designed for new contributors. Trainees focus on fundamentals while building their initial reputation.*

- No minimum stake required
- Access to core tasks
- Must maintain ≥ 90% task quality
- All work is validated by higher-ranked contributors
- Capped at 100 tasks before progression

### Level 2: Contributor (200-599)
*The backbone of the network. Contributors have proven reliability and begin validating others.*

- **Minimum stake:** 250 $SAPIEN
- **Required quality rating:** ≥ 95%
- Access to standard tasks + basic validation
- Eligible for performance-based reward multipliers
- Participation in validation pools begins here

### Level 3: Expert (600-799)
*Experienced contributors with a track record of excellence. Experts play a key role in quality enforcement and specialized data work.*

- **Minimum stake:** 500 $SAPIEN
- **Required quality rating:** ≥ 98%
- Access to premium/specialized tasks
- Full validation rights for Trainee and Contributor work
- Priority access to new task types
- Can form specialized validation pools

### Level 4: Master (800-1000)
*The protocol's most trusted contributors. Masters help guide quality standards and have early access to protocol-critical tasks.*

- **Minimum stake:** 2500 $SAPIEN
- **Required quality rating:** ≥ 99%
- Access to all task types, including advanced protocol work
- Lead validators for complex workflows
- Highest available reward multipliers
- May be eligible for governance roles (pending future implementation)

> **Note:** Staking requirements will be reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis.

## Quality Assurance & Staking Mechanism

**How Sapien Enforces Quality at Scale.**

High-quality data is the foundation of effective AI. In Sapien, quality isn't enforced by centralized managers — it's enforced through incentives, peer validation, and onchain consequences.

Every contribution is backed by economic skin in the game. Every validator is another layer of accountability. And every reputation score is a public signal of trust.

Together, this creates a scalable, self-reinforcing loop that rewards performance — and penalizes inaccuracy.

### 1. Staking as Collateral
Before completing tasks, contributors stake $SAPIEN tokens as a commitment to quality. This stake acts as collateral — if the work is validated as high-quality, they earn rewards. If it falls short, they may be slashed.

### SAPIEN Quality Assurance Process

| Level | Stake Required | Quality Requirement |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Master Validators** | 2500+ SAPIEN Staked | 99%+ Quality |
| **Expert Validators** | 500+ SAPIEN Staked | 98%+ Quality |
| **Contributors** | 250+ SAPIEN Staked | 95%+ Quality |
| **Trainees** | 0 SAPIEN Staked | 90%+ Quality |

### 2. Peer Validation by Reputation Tier
All work on Sapien is reviewed by higher-reputation contributors in the system:

- **Masters** validate Experts
- **Experts** validate Contributors
- **Contributors** validate Trainees

Critical or high-value tasks may require multiple independent validators. This hierarchical peer review ensures quality enforcement scales with network growth.

### 3. Slashing and Consequences
Validators can flag work that doesn't meet standards. Based on the severity and frequency of quality violations, contributors face escalating consequences:

#### Quality Control: Stake-Based Consequences

| Violation Level | Consequence |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Minor Violation** | Warnings & Training |
| **Moderate Violation** | Up to 25% Stake Slash |
| **Severe Violation** | Up to 100% Stake Slash |

### 4. Incentives for Quality and Commitment
Rewards scale with both performance and stake duration:

- **Top 20% of contributors** (by SLA and quality) earn a **1.5x performance multiplier**
- **Staking for longer periods** adds additional multipliers:

| Level | Minimum Stake | Quality Requirement |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Trainee | 0 SAPIEN | 90%+ |
| Contributor | 500 SAPIEN | 95%+ |
| Expert | 1000 SAPIEN | 98%+ |
| Master | 5000 SAPIEN | 99%+ |

**Example:** A contributor completing work worth 100 tokens, in the top 20%, with a 6-month stake:

```
100 × 1.5 × 1.25 = 187.5 $SAPIEN earned
```

### 5. Unstaking and Early Withdrawal
Contributors may unstake after their chosen lock period, subject to:

- **2-day cooldown period**
- **20% penalty** for early exit
- **Loss of multiplier eligibility**
- **Possible reputation impact**

This system balances flexibility with long-term alignment.

### Outcome: A Self-Regulating System

- **Good work** = higher earnings, better reputation, broader access
- **Poor work** = real consequences, enforced by code and peers
- **No centralized QA team required**

The result is a scalable, trustless quality control loop — one that gets stronger as more contributors join and advance through the protocol.

---

## Reward Mechanics

**How Contributors Earn More with Performance and Commitment.**

Sapien's reward system is designed to incentivize not just participation — but excellence and long-term alignment.

There are two main levers that increase contributor rewards:

1. **Performance multipliers** — based on your task accuracy and SLA (service level agreement) compliance
2. **Staking multipliers** — based on how long you commit your tokens

Together, these create meaningful upside for contributors who consistently deliver quality and stake with confidence.

### 1. Performance Multipliers
Contributors are scored against their peers each reward cycle. The **top 20% of performers** — those with the highest accuracy and reliability — receive a **1.5× bonus multiplier**.

Performance is measured against peers, with additional rewards for consistent quality:

- **Top 20% of performers** (meeting SLAs): **1.5x multiplier**
- **Remaining participants** (meeting SLAs): **1.0x multiplier**
- **Below SLA performance**: No rewards, potential stake slashing

### 2. Staking Multipliers (Lock Duration)
Contributors who lock their stake for longer periods earn additional multipliers:

| Lock Period | Reward Multiplier |
|-------------|------------------|
| 1 month | 1.05x |
| 3 months | 1.10x |
| 6 months | 1.25x |
| 12 months | 1.50x |

These stack with performance multipliers to increase total earnings.

### 3. Example Calculation
A contributor who completes tasks worth 100 $SAPIEN, performs in the top 20%, and has a 6-month stake lock would earn:

```
100 × 1.5 (performance) × 1.25 (stake) = 187.5 $SAPIEN
```

This structure ensures the most committed, high-performing contributors are the best compensated — aligning earnings with protocol health.

### 4. Reward Distribution Timing
- Rewards are distributed on a regular cycle (e.g. weekly or bi-weekly, as defined by protocol parameters)
- Earnings are sent directly to contributor wallets via smart contract

### Summary Table

| Incentive Type | Multiplier | Notes |
|---------------|------------|-------|
| Performance Bonus | Up to 1.5× | Based on top 20% accuracy + SLA |
| Stake Lock Bonus | Up to 1.5× | Based on duration of token commitment |
| **Total Possible** | **Up to 2.25×** | **Multipliers stack for high performers** |

---

## Quality Control

The protocol maintains high standards through a graduated system of consequences for quality issues:

### Minor Quality Issues
Early intervention focuses on improvement rather than punishment. Minor issues result in warnings, temporary restrictions, and required training, without direct stake slashing.

### Moderate Quality Issues
Persistent quality problems or rule violations trigger more serious consequences:

- Up to 25% stake slash
- 7-day task restriction
- Performance multiplier reset
- 25% reputation impact
- Mandatory re-qualification

### Severe Violations
Major violations or malicious behavior result in:

- Up to 100% stake slash
- Permanent protocol ban
- Complete reputation loss
- Network blacklisting

## Stake Management

Contributors can unstake their tokens after their chosen lock period, subject to:

- **2-day cooldown period**
- **20% penalty** for early withdrawal
- **Loss of earned multipliers**
- **Reputation impact consideration**

### Quality System Principles

1. All participants have meaningful "skin in the game"
2. Quality work is consistently rewarded
3. Validation is incentivized through additional rewards
4. Poor quality has real economic consequences
5. Long-term participation is encouraged through multipliers

## LP Staking

### Overview
LP staking enables both active protocol participants and token holders to contribute to SAPIEN's market liquidity while earning additional SAPIEN token rewards. This system enables markets for token holders while creating extra opportunities to receive additional SAPIEN tokens beyond direct protocol participation.

### Mechanics

#### Eligible Pairs
- SAPIEN/ETH
- SAPIEN/USDC
- Additional pairs to be added based on community governance

#### Base Reward Structure
- **Annual base reward rate:** 7.5% in SAPIEN tokens
- **Rewards distributed:** Daily
- **Minimum stake:** 1,000 SAPIEN equivalent in LP tokens

### Lock Period Multipliers

| Lock Period | Reward Multiplier | Minimum Stake |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| 1 month | 1.1x | 1,000 SAPIEN |
| 3 months | 1.25x | 1,000 SAPIEN |
| 6 months | 1.5x | 1,000 SAPIEN |
| 12 months | 2.0x | 1,000 SAPIEN |

### Reward Calculation

```
Total LP Staking Reward = Base Reward Rate × Lock-up Multiplier × Staked LP Token Amount
```

**Example:**
- **Stake:** $1,000 worth of LP tokens
- **Period:** 6 months (1.5x multiplier)
- **Annual Reward:** $1,000 × 7.5% × 1.5 = $112.50 worth of SAPIEN tokens
