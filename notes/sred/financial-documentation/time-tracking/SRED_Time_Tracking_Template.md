## Detailed Activity Descriptions

### Research Activities
**Example**: "Conducted systematic literature review of smart contract upgrade patterns, focusing on UUPS vs Transparent Proxy implementations. Analyzed 15 academic papers and 8 production implementations to understand security trade-offs and gas optimization strategies. Documented findings in technical research report."

### Experimental Development Activities  
**Example**: "Implemented prototype VestingManager contract using UUPS upgradeable pattern. Developed novel fund custody mechanism that eliminates centralization risks while maintaining upgrade capability. Tested cross-contract communication patterns and measured gas costs compared to current implementation."

### Testing Activities
**Example**: "Designed and executed comprehensive test suite for separated contract architecture. Implemented fuzz testing to identify edge cases in vesting schedule calculations. Performed security testing to validate access controls and upgrade mechanisms. Documented test results and coverage metrics."
