# Senior Smart Contract Engineer — Sapien.io

**Build the future of Proof-of-Quality.**

---

## About Sapien

Sapien.io is pioneering the **Proof-of-Quality (PoQ)** network — a new trust layer where human-verified data becomes a first-class primitive for AI, crypto, and decentralized systems. Our team includes engineers and builders from top Web3 companies. We move with intention: fast, lean, and always toward production-ready impact, not research artifacts.

As AI systems scale and automated agents dominate the internet, the world needs a verifiable layer for human judgement. **Sapien is that layer.**

If you're driven to build robust smart contract infrastructure and developer tooling for a new category of decentralized networks, you'll feel at home here.

## The Role — Senior Smart Contract Engineer

We are looking for a **Senior Smart Contract Engineer** to design, implement, and maintain the core smart contracts powering the Sapien protocol. You will work closely with the protocol team to build production-grade contracts using Foundry and OpenZeppelin, while also developing TypeScript SDKs and integration adapters that enable seamless interaction with the Sapien network.

This role combines deep Solidity expertise with strong TypeScript fundamentals — you'll ship contracts and the developer tooling that makes them accessible.

## Responsibilities

### Smart Contract Development
- Design, develop, and deploy secure smart contracts using Solidity, Foundry, and OpenZeppelin standards.
- Implement staking mechanisms, reward distribution systems, attestation flows, and settlement logic.
- Write comprehensive test suites using Foundry's testing framework (unit, integration, fuzz, and invariant tests).
- Optimize contracts for gas efficiency while maintaining readability and security.

### SDK & Integration Development
- Build and maintain TypeScript SDKs that abstract contract interactions for external developers and internal services.
- Develop integration adapters for wallets, dApps, and third-party protocols.
- Create clear, well-documented APIs and developer tooling that accelerates ecosystem adoption.

### Security & Quality
- Conduct thorough security reviews and collaborate with external auditors.
- Apply best practices for upgradeable contracts, access control, and on-chain safety.
- Participate in code reviews and uphold high engineering standards across the codebase.

### Collaboration
- Work with the protocol team to translate specifications into production-ready implementations.
- Contribute to technical documentation, deployment scripts, and operational tooling.

## Qualifications

### Required
- **3+ years** of Solidity development in production environments.
- Strong proficiency with **Foundry** (forge, cast, anvil) for development, testing, and deployment.
- Experience building on **OpenZeppelin** contracts (access control, upgradeable patterns).
- **2+ years** of TypeScript/JavaScript experience, ideally building SDKs, libraries, or developer tools.
- Deep understanding of smart contract security, gas optimization, and EVM internals.
- Familiarity with DeFi patterns, staking systems, or incentive-driven protocols.
- Experience with **ethers.js** or **viem** for contract interaction layers.

### Nice to Have
- Background in building multi-chain deployments or cross-chain systems.
- Contributions to open-source Web3 projects or developer tooling.
- Experience with formal verification tools or advanced testing methodologies.
